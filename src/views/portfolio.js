                    Joined Baires to work for Instructure Inc as a Node
                    Developer for Commons, an online platform where people share
                    content for education. I started helping the team update the
                    application UI (by moving to Instructure Design components
                    on React), improving its search (using ElasticSearch and
                    updating some search queries), implementing new
                    functionality and giving support to reported bugs.

                    <br />A year later I joined their Professional Services
                    team, now working with Canvas reports and custom tools
                    developed for Instructure&rsquo;s customers. Here I got to
                    work with a mix of Rails and React, got to do some
                    interesting queries for Postgres in order to deliver some
                    custom reports and got experience working with AWS.

                    Domicilios.com started as a coupon service that saw a
                    potential in the food delivery area, quickly evolving into a
                    platform dedicated in solving this problem. I was part of
                    this transition from the beginning, this allowed me to work
                    on some of the key parts that helped the company become one
                    of the most important online food delivery companies in
                    Colombia.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    With PHP as its main language and CakePHP as its core
                    platform, we started from the ground up and as the company
                    grew, there was a need for an admin panel in order to manage
                    the platform content which at the time I designed with the
                    latest tools available: jQuery and Bootstrap 2.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As more orders were made, we got a new challenge: We needed
                    to keep track of the orders, sometimes call the restaurant
                    and pass it or simply notify them so the customer can get
                    the food as fast as possible. For this I designed a solution
                    that was able to assign orders to different agents, trying
                    to balance the orders by keeping all of the agents with at
                    least one order but at the same time grouping multiple
                    orders of the same restaurant so only one call was needed.
                    <br />
                    The more the company grew, the more complex the operation
                    became, I was an active part of the team providing solutions
                    for the whole company and when we got acquired by
                    DeliveryHero and more people joined the tech team, I focused
                    on delivering a new website with an improved experience,
                    this time working with React more modern tools.

                    VerdeMedia was a company that revolutionized the way people
                    recycled by delivering machines that turned recycled
                    material into points. <br />
                    <br />I was in charge of the bridge between the machine and
                    the user, I designed a finite state machine that talked to a
                    hardware in order to give points for each recycled material,
                    having a database of products we could identify the type of
                    material being recycled and using a set of sensors we knew
                    if the product entered completely the machine to avoid
                    scams. <br />
